              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                Sokarie was born from a simple belief: every woman deserves to feel confident, 
                elegant, and authentically herself. Founded in 2020 by Sophie Chen, our brand 
                emerged from the desire to create fashion that transcends trends and speaks to 
                the timeless elegance within every woman.
              </p>
              <p>
                What started as a small collection of carefully curated pieces has grown into 
                a global fashion destination. We're not just about clothing â€“ we're about 
                empowering women to express their unique style and embrace their confidence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, Sokarie serves thousands of women worldwide, each piece telling a story 
                of craftsmanship, sustainability, and the celebration of feminine strength.
